## Interests
I am also interested in topics at the intersection of Economics and Defense. In particular, in how the topography of global economic networks can be leveraged to strengthen military alliances, and increase countries' informational advantage and coercive power vis-à-vis their adversaries.

## Courses taken
- **_"Political Economy of International Security"_** with [Prof. Paul Poast](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/directory/paul-poast) at [The Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/) 
    * Topics covered included the economic basis of military power, the political economy of international alliances, The Commercial Peace theory, international migration and national security.
- [**_"Diplomacy and Defense"_**](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/programs-degrees/courses/diplomacy-defense) with instructor [Saad Ansari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saadhansari/) at the [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) 
    * This was a studies-based program geared toward developing our skills
around collaborative intelligence, like scenario-planning simulations.
The final project was a war-gaming simulation of the U.S. intervention
in Yemen.
